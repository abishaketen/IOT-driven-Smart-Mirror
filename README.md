# IOT-driven-Smart-Mirror
Project Overview:

An innovative IoT-based Smart Mirror designed to seamlessly integrate hardware and software, providing users with an interactive, personalized experience using real-time data, facial recognition, and voice interaction.

Key Features:

Hardware-Software Integration:

Designed and implemented a smart mirror system using Raspberry Pi, combining IoT functionalities with user-centered interface design to create an engaging and interactive display.

Facial Recognition & Voice Interaction:

Built a robust facial recognition system to identify users and tailored mirror content accordingly, providing a personalized experience. Integrated voice interaction to allow hands-free control and access to information, enhancing accessibility and interactivity.

Real-Time Data with APIs:

Leveraged multiple APIs to pull real-time data, including:
Weather Information: Displays local and global weather conditions, updating regularly for accuracy.
Current Events & News: Presents recent headlines and relevant news topics to keep users informed.
Calendar & Time: Displays date and time along with any calendar events, allowing users to stay organized.
Seamless User Experience: Crafted a user-friendly interface that adapts based on individual preferences, offering a modern, smart home experience right from the mirror.

Technical Highlights

Raspberry Pi as the Core Controller:
Used Raspberry Pi as the central controller to manage input from the camera and microphone, communicate with APIs, and render the display.

Modular Code Structure:
Designed modular code to handle facial recognition, API integration, and voice command processing separately, enhancing code readability, maintainability, and scalability.

Voice Command Processing:
Implemented voice processing functionality with a microphone to enable users to interact with the smart mirror hands-free, including commands to access specific data or change settings.
